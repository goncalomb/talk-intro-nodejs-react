# React Tips & Tricks

---

## React

---

### PureComponent

```js
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent
```

```js
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return (
        !shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps) ||
        !shallowEqual(this.state, nextState)
    );
}
```

---

### PureComponent

Use PureComponent to avoid unnecessary render calls.

* list items
* connected components (Redux)
* independent sections of an application

Overhead is low.

---

### PureComponent

```js
const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
  /* */
});
```

---

### "Complex" Render Functions

Avoid passing objects to children that fail the shallow compare of PureComponent.

* avoid inline event handlers (arrow functions)
* avoid creating objects
* avoid inline data manipulations
* simple conditionals and primitive results are acceptable

---

This will trigger a render function of MyComponent...

```jsx
<MyComponent
    someOptions={{
        foo: true,
        bar: "test"
    }}
/>
```

Even with PureComponent.

---

### Large Lists

* consider virtualization libraries for large sets of data (react-virtualized)
* react-dnd doesn't scale well with lots of targets (html5 dnd)

---

### Large Components

Avoid monolithic components with large render functions.

Favor small, pure components.

---

### But...

---

### Measure. Measure. Measure.

React Developer Tools (Profiler) on Chrome.

---

## Redux

---

### Mutations on Reducers

* avoid deep clones
* shallow clone up to the property being changed

---

```js
// state.list[index].options.name = "Test"

state.list = [ ...state.list ];

state.list[index] = {
    ...state.list[index],
    options: {
        ...state.list[index].options,
        name: "Test"
    }
};
```

---

### Actions

Improve readability and functionality by using...

* small actions
* more redux-thunk
* action names as constants

---

## Styled Components

---

### Reusable Components

* use un-opinionated styling: avoid fixed sizes/margins/offsets
* provide a 'className' prop...

---

### className

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return {
            <div className={this.props.className}>
                <a href="#">test</a>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

const MyComponentStyled = styled(MyComponent)`
    background-color: red;
`;
```

---

### Extending

```js
const Button = styled.button`
    border-radius: 3px;
    color: gray;
`;
const RedButton = styled(Button)`
    color: red;
`;
```

---

### Referring

```js
const Link = styled.`
    color: blue;
`;
const Section = styled.div`
    ${Link}:hover {
        color: red
    }
`;
```
